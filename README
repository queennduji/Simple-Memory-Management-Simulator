		Compiling and Testing Instructions

	The code is compiled using gcc filename.c, and executed in the same folder as a file named ‘test’.

	The paging allocator may not work as intended if it is initialized with a value which is not evenly divisible by 32, as each page is exactly 32 bytes.

	When testing the program, there must be exactly one space between an ‘A’ or ‘D’ and the following byte value, and there must be a line break after the initialize line, and each allocate/deallocate/print line.

This will use the segmentation allocator because the mode is 0.

Execution Results: 

SEGMENTATION FAULT WITH PROCESS PID: 4, NO HOLE LARGE ENOUGH
SEGMENTATION FAULT WITH PROCESS PID: 6, NO HOLE LARGE ENOUGH
Memory size = 1024 bytes, allocated = 776 bytes, free = 248
There are currently 1 holes, and 2 active processes
